# Coin Meter
A Website to get real-time data of cryptocurrencies with a nice user interface, animation and charts.
## NOTE: I have used flask for creating REST API for calling my API as My API provider is not following the CORS policy, as flask is not in our syllabus I am not using it as a backend (calling flask by javascript fetch).
## THIS IS MY COLLEGE PROJECT FOR SUBJECT INT-219 (FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPER)
